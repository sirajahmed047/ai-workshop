- Consider a slightly more distinctive font for headings (like Space Grotesk or Outfit)
- Implement a clear typographic hierarchy with appropriate font weights and sizes

## Visual Elements
- Add abstract AI-generated artwork as section backgrounds or decorative elements
- Include animated illustrations showing AI generation processes
- Use geometric patterns and circuit-like designs as subtle background elements
