# AI Workshop Project Rules and Guidelines

## Project Overview
This project consists of two main components:
1. A landing page for an AI Workshop business targeting college students
2. A survey form to collect student preferences and information

## Technical Stack

### Landing Page (GitHub Pages)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Framework**: Vanilla JS (no framework) or lightweight options like Alpine.js if needed
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS or pure CSS
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach

### Survey Form
- **Platform**: Google Forms (primary) or Microsoft Forms (alternative)
- **Integration**: Embedded in the landing page or linked via button

## Development Rules

1. **Code Structure**
   - Use semantic HTML elements
   - Maintain a clean directory structure:
     ```
     ai-workshop/
     ├── index.html
     ├── assets/
     │   ├── css/
     │   ├── js/
     │   └── images/
     ├── pages/ (if additional pages are needed)
     └── README.md
     ```

2. **Performance Guidelines**
   - Optimize all images before committing
   - Minimize HTTP requests
   - Use modern CSS techniques (Flexbox/Grid)
   - Keep JavaScript minimal and unobtrusive

3. **Accessibility Requirements**
   - Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Include proper alt text for all images
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works
   - Maintain sufficient color contrast

4. **GitHub Pages Specific**
   - Main branch will be used for deployment
   - Ensure index.html is in the root directory
   - Test locally before pushing changes

5. **Survey Form Rules**
   - Keep questions concise and clear
   - Limit required fields to essential information only
   - Ensure proper form validation
   - Maintain consistent styling with landing page

## Content Guidelines
- Use professional, educational tone
- Focus on benefits to students
